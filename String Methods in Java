String Methods in Java
Java's String class provides a rich set of methods to manipulate and query strings. Here are some commonly used methods:

Character Inspection:

charAt(int index): Returns the character at the specified index.
String Comparison:

compareTo(String anotherString): Compares two strings lexicographically.
compareToIgnoreCase(String str): Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences.
equals(Object anObject): Compares this string to the specified object.
equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString): Compares this string to another string, ignoring case considerations.
Substring Search:

contains(CharSequence s): Returns true if the string contains the specified sequence of char values.
startsWith(String prefix): Checks if the string starts with the specified prefix.
startsWith(String prefix, int toffset): Checks if the substring of this string starting at the specified index starts with the specified prefix.
endsWith(String suffix): Checks if the string ends with the specified suffix.
Substring Extraction:

substring(int beginIndex): Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.
substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex): Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.
String Modification:

replace(char oldChar, char newChar): Returns a string resulting from replacing all occurrences of oldChar in this string with newChar.
replace(CharSequence target, CharSequence replacement): Replaces each substring of this string that matches the literal target sequence with the specified literal replacement sequence.
replaceAll(String regex, String replacement): Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.
replaceFirst(String regex, String replacement): Replaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.
Trimming and Stripping:

trim(): Returns a string whose value is this string, with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.
strip(): Returns a string whose value is this string, with all leading and trailing white space removed.
stripLeading(): Returns a string whose value is this string, with all leading white space removed.
stripTrailing(): Returns a string whose value is this string, with all trailing white space removed.
Case Conversion:

toLowerCase(): Converts all of the characters in this string to lower case.
toUpperCase(): Converts all of the characters in this string to upper case.
Length and Emptiness Check:

length(): Returns the length of this string.
isEmpty(): Returns true if, and only if, length() is 0.
isBlank(): Returns true if the string is empty or contains only white space codepoints.
Splitting and Joining:

split(String regex): Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.
join(CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence... elements): Returns a new String composed of copies of the CharSequence elements joined together with a copy of the specified delimiter.
Conversion:

toCharArray(): Converts this string to a new character array.
valueOf(int i): Returns the string representation of the int argument. There are overloads for other primitive types as well.
